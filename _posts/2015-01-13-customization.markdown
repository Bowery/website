## Linux Distributions 

Bowery can support any Linux distribution, but runs the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server image out of the box. If you would like to set up Bowery with another Linux distribution just get in touch with us at [Hello at Bowery.io](mailto:hello@bowery.io) and we'll help you get set up securely.

## Availability Zones 

All Bowery teams are hosted on Google Compute Engine in the US Central Availability Zone. If you would like to move your apps to a different availability zone for higher performance, just get in touch with us at [Hello at Bowery.io](mailto:hello@bowery.io). 

## On Premise 

Bowery runs code from your computer (PC, Mac, Linux) in a remote copy of your production environment. We host these remote copies on cloud instances, so you don't have to worry about running application environments locally. This lets you bypass version conflicts, operating system dependency issues, and a host of other operational problems.

If cloud-based environments are not ideal for your workflow, we can help you set up Bowery to work on-premise in your organization. Just reach out to [Hello at Bowery.io](mailto:Hello@Bowery.io) and we'll help you get started.

## Cloud Providers 

Bowery hosts a remote copy of your production environment on Google Compute engine, so you don't have to worry about running application environments locally. 

If [Google Compute](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) hosted apps are not ideal for your organization we can help you set up Bowery to work with the cloud provider of your choice such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace. Just reach out to [Hello at Bowery.io](mailto:Hello@Bowery.io) and we'll help you get started.
