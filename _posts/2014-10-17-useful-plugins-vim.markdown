Because [Bowery](http://bowery.io) allows you to use any text editor you want, we wanted to highlight some of the best plugins for our favorite text editors. Here's our second post, for Vim. You can view [our first post on Sublime Text 3 plugins here](http://bowery.io/blog/posts/2014/10/09/useful-plugins-sublime.html).

**1. [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)** Vundle is a Vim plugin manager, allowing you to track and configure your plugins from within your .vimrc. It also takes care of keeping your plugins updated and cleaning unused plugins.

**2. [Netrw](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075) and [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)** Netrw is a file system explorer for Vim. It lets you open up your folders and view documents much in the way that Apple’s Finder does. Nerdtree is another popular file system explorer.

**3. [CheckSyntax](https://github.com/tomtom/checksyntax_vim)** This plugin checks your code for syntax errors and is compatible with r, javascript, ruby, and php, among others.

**4. [SearchComplete](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=474)** SearchComplete gives you tab completion within the search bar. It saves us a bunch of time day to day.

**5. [Fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)**
Fugitive.vim is a wrapper for Git, making it easy to checkout, commit code, and even view the current file on Github.

**6. [The NERD Commenter](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218)** Lets you easily comment your code, and is available for nearly all filetypes. 

**7. [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)** Syntastic highlights errors in your syntax and provides useful feedback and warnings.

**8. [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)** Surround provides mappings to manipulate parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and any other pairs of characters you routinely use when programming.

**9. [SnippetsEMU](https://github.com/vim-scripts/snippetsEmu)** SnippetsEMU lets you quickly insert data that you would prefer not to type out into your document. It is based off the ‘Snippets’ feature of TextMate. 

**10. [Taglist](https://github.com/vim-scripts/taglist.vim)** Taglist can show you all of the classes in your code along with their methods. Also, it stores history of recently accessed files and their methods, so you easily go back to something you worked on earlier.
