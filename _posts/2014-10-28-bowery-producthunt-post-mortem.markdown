Last Tuesday we announced Bowery 3, a desktop app that makes it easy to set up, manage, and share your development environment. We posted our redesign and app to Product Hunt, which has quickly become the go-to community for discovering the best new apps, tools, and sites.

The feedback we received in the comments was postive and constructive, and the Product Hunt community was clearly interested in our product. But what do the numbers show?
<br /><br />

### Tuesday, October 21 — Launch day
51% of all referral sessions and 52% of new website visitors from referrals on our launch day came from Product Hunt. 93% of visitors from Product Hunt had never visited Bowery.io before. 91% of visitors came from the Product Hunt homepage, meaning they clicked through before even reading the comments. To date, we've received 410 upvotes and were in second place on the leaderboard for most of the day. We were second to a [hoverboard](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard), and we're completely okay with that.
<br /><br />

### Wednesday, October 22 — Still going strong
We got a second bump from the Product Hunt recap email the following morning, with 42% of our referrals and 42% of new users coming from the Product Hunt. 25% of all sessions from Product Hunt on those two days were from the email; that is to say, a meaningful portion of Product Hunt users rely on the daily email to check out new products. On both days, Product Hunt was our largest traffic referrer. 
<br /><br />

### The long tail
After Tuesday and Wednesday, we've still received a steady trickle of traffic from Product Hunt. In the week since our launch, Product Hunt accounts for roughly 20% of referral traffic. And 15% of our total Product Hunt traffic came after the first two days.
