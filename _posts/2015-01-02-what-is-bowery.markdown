### What is Bowery? 

Bowery is the Terminal that keeps your team in sync. With Bowery, your entire team can keep their runtimes up-to-date in the same way Github houses your code-- by committing to a central location. Bowery hosts your environment and helps you share it with others so you can spend time focusing on what you do best, building your application. 

By keeping your software and operating systems in-sync across your team and organization, Bowery helps you remove the operational overhead of managing development environments for your organization. 

Bowery is available to use on Windows, Mac and Linux. 

### Why use Bowery? 

1. **Remove Operational Overhead**: You don't need to build your own environment management system. Let Bowery manage it for you. With Bowery, you keep your team’s stack and versions up-to-date across all projects, removing the small incompatibilities across your team that cause disruption in the software delivery process. Don’t worry about builds failing in production because of a tool gap. With Bowery your team can keep development and production parity across your team.

2. **Know What Your Code Does When It Ships**: With Bowery, your code, software and operating systems are all in sync across your team and organization leading to greater productivity in development and greater parity with your production environment. Don't worry about code breaking in production. With Bowery, your whole team can code in your production environment. When it comes time to upgrade a database or change versions of your language, the process is swift and painless. 

By staying in sync you can keep the gap between your development, staging and production environments as small as possible.
