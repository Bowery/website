Developer productivity is not all about how many lines of code you can write in a day and it’s not about how fast you can complete a given task. In truth there’s no one trait or silver bullet that will help you become a more productive developer. It’s a combination of the practices, tricks and tools that you employ to improve software quality and delivery every day. 

At Bowery, our goal is to enable stronger and more productive developers. So we set out to get advice from the most talented and productive developers we know on how they manage their time to stay on task and productive. We spoke with Jenn Voss, Senior Consultant for SunGuard, a Mentor at Girl Develop It in Philadelphia and organizer of the [Philly Front-End/UX Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/phlfux/). She's also a huge Billiards fan and has been playing competitively for five years. See how she manages it all and more with ease. 

###What do you do?

I'm a Senior Consultant for [SunGard Consulting Services](http://www.sungard.com/), specializing in front end development.
		
###What are three qualities that make you a strong developer?
	
Curiosity, efficiency, and patience.

###What are some tactics you’ve developed that help you write really high-quality code?

If I had to narrow it down to a few things, I'd say determine a set of code standards with your team, and automate them as much as possible. Write tests for all your functional code; well written tests will not only prevent bugs, they can also serve as documentation to make clear what certain features are supposed to do and help get new team members up to speed quickly. Lastly, make sure others review your code. On my current team we have at least 2 others approve code changes before they are merged. This keeps everyone on the same page and can significantly improve code quality. 
	
	
###What are some best practices you’ve developed to work better with your team?

Good communication is important. It's easy for people to get buried in their own projects. Set aside time to discuss recently completed features, new discoveries in your field or just whatever your team finds interesting. Projects run smoother overall when the whole team is aware of each other's work. Also, documentation is key. Good developers know how to write and follow documentation and this can save you a lot of time in the long run. Keep a README file in the root of your project with basic setup instructions and notes. It's also a good idea to host a wiki somewhere with more detailed information, that way team members who may not work directly with the code repository such as project managers or designers can easily access and update it.
	

###How do you (how does your company) measure your own productivity or that of your team?

We look at a number of things to determine productivity, since one aspect never tells the full story. As a consultant I spend the majority of my time with clients, so my company uses peer reviews, client feedback and self assessments to help measure performance. I also try to keep a list of notable tasks I've completed and work related activities and events I've attended so that I can easily refer to it when needed.


###One frustrating thing for developers is often maintaining technical debt. How do you and your team manage proper maintenance of high-quality code in your app/project?

We keep track of technical debt by leveraging project management tools, the same way we do for any other task. As soon as it's identified, we document it and discuss during sprint planning. If the team approves, it gets assigned to a sprint or completed as time becomes available. The key to this is that team members continuously identify and document areas for improvement. 


###What are some tools you and your team use to maximize productivity?

Project management software is essential, such as [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [Trello](https://trello.com/). [Skype](skype.com) and [Slack](slack.com) are great for communication. Knowing how to optimize your development tools is also important and can save you lots of time. For example if you're testing your code with browser development tools every day like I am, they can be easy to use off the bat without any training. However if you invest some time in researching those tools and learning the advanced features and shortcuts, your productivity can increase exponentially.  


###What is a big challenge that you overcame in your engineering career?

There hasn't been one big challenge so much as many small challenges. There's always something new to learn or a new problem to solve, and that's part of why I love my job, but it can be daunting to keep up with. Learning to take a step back and focus on one thing at a time has helped me move forward numerous times.
	

###Have you ever had a mentor at a new job? Has that helped improve your skills or your productivity over time?

Absolutely. Having a mentor helped me define my goals, and also kept me on track to complete them. Once you have a good mentor and realize how valuable they can be, you never want to be without one, regardless of your level or age. They can of course change over time, and sometimes you have to actively look for them, but remember it doesn't hurt to ask for advice. I also encourage everyone to try and be a mentor to others, since the relationship works both ways- mentors can often learn a lot from their students.
