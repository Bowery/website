Because [Bowery](http://bowery.io) allows you to use any text editor you want, we wanted to highlight some of the best plugins for our favorite text editors. Here's our first post, for Sublime Text 3.

**1. [Package control](https://sublime.wbond.net)**
This is effectively bundler for your ST2 plugins. It enables you to install and manage your plugins directly from Sublime Text 2. It’s pretty simple to use and will help keep things organized. 

**2. [Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git/wiki)**
This plugin is a front-end for working with Git, and is pretty necessary if you work with Git on a daily basis. It enables you to run a few Git commands directly from your editor.

**3. [Sidebar Enhancements](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements/tree/st3)**
Sidebar enhancements extends the sidebar, adding extra useful features to it. 

**4. [FileDiffs](https://github.com/colinta/SublimeFileDiffs)**
FileDiffs lets you compare two different files in ST2 and see the differences between the two. It’s really useful for matching up different versions of the same file.

**5. [Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime) and Hayaku**
Emmet lets you type abbreviations which you can then expand into full HTML with a press of the tab button. [Hayaku](https://github.com/hayaku/hayaku) does something similar for CSS.

**6. [Terminal](https://github.com/wbond/sublime_terminal)**
This one’s pretty straightforward—it enables you to launch terminal from a given folder in Sublime. 

**7. [Trimmer](https://github.com/jonlabelle/Trimmer)**
This plugin is for removing unnecessary spaces, which may prove useful if you are coding in javascript.

**8. [Additional Syntax Support](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/sublime-text-plugins/)**
Sublime Text does not support all languages, so some of your code may not have proper syntax highlighting. Here are the plugins for some unsupported languages:

- [LESS](https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime)
- [Sass](https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle)
- [SCSS](https://github.com/MarioRicalde/SCSS.tmbundle)
- [Stylus](https://github.com/billymoon/Stylus)
- [Jade](https://github.com/P233/Jade-Snippets-for-Sublime-Text-2)

**9. [Sublime Linter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)**
Sublime Linter finds errors in your code as you are working, giving your text editors the advantages of an IDE.

**10. Custom Themes** Lastly, here are a few plugins that are not super technical, but are just meant to change up the aesthetics a bit. Although Sublime comes with some great themes, you may get bored of them after a while, so try these out if you do. 

- [SpaceGray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray/)
- [Centurion](https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion)
- [Soda](http://buymeasoda.github.io/soda-theme/)
