Hi everyone!

In this post-Thanksgiving update, we're including a couple of UI enchancements to make it easier to use Bowery. Specifically, we added a file system dialog so you can choose which folder to sync with Bowery without needing to type out the entire path. Also, we added more clear status updates when creating a new application so you know exactly what's going on at any given time.

Windows users: we now implemented the auto-updater for Windows, so this should be the last version you'll have to manually update to.

Hope you enjoy the new changes!
