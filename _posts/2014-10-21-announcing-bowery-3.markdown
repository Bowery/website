When we started working on Bowery less than a year ago, our vision was to allow developers to never have to install software in a local development environment again. The current version of Bowery has been public since the end of March. We listened to all of your feedback and added features—readable URLs, pull functionality, better Windows support—that made Bowery more powerful, but also more bloated.

So a few months ago, we took a step back and asked a few questions. What are users using Bowery to do? What are their current dev/prod setups? And how can we take all of these different features and make them easily and elegantly usable?

The result is Bowery 3. Install our desktop application on Windows, Mac, or Linux and tell us (1) where you code is on your local computer and (2) what software you need on the server for that code to run. We'll take care of provisioning the server with your AWS credentials and then sync your code whenever you make changes locally.

> “As a developer, the Bowery app is simple and lets me focus on coding instead of the headache of configuring my environment. Everyone from designers to web developers, startups to large enterprises can benefit from Bowery. Its simple interface eliminates the need for other unnecessarily complicated infrastructure solutions.” 

—Alex Garrett, creator of phpacademy, one of the largest YouTube communities for PHP developers with 100,000+ subscribers and millions of total views.

Our singular goal is to help you write better code, faster. Bowery 3 moves us ten times closer to that goal, and we hope you agree.

## Fundraising
We're also announcing we've raised a $1.5 million seed round from a list of fantastic investors. SV Angel, Google Ventures, Bloomberg Beta, RRE, Homebrew, Betaworks,  BOLDstart Ventures, Magnet Agency, Deep Fork Capital, and angel investors Naveen Selvadurai and Ryan Holmes participated in the round, adding to our existing investors of General Catalyst’s Rough Draft Ventures and First Round Capital’s Dorm Room Fund.

We chose these investors because they're bought into our vision of better developer tools for everyone, and we can't wait to work with them to achieve that vision.

> “Bowery changes the way developers work. Engineering time is one of the largest expenses for companies today, and every second saved measurably affects profit margins. Engineers love Bowery because it makes their lives easier, and everyone else in the company loves it because it makes it easier to build amazing products and services. It’s one of the best dev tools companies we’ve seen.”

—Kevin Carter, Partner, SV Angel


## Redesign
Alongside our desktop app launch, we're taking our new brand live. Bowery is a historic street, and the new logo and brand reflect the storied history of the street while unifying our website and app design. The points of the new logo are each a street corner in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City. We'll do a more detailed post on the new design thinking soon.

## Bowery 2
What happens to Bowery 2? All the features in the Bowery command-line version will be present in Bowery 3. Because Bowery 2 only synced your code from your local machine, you should still have a local copy of your codebase. Your code will be available on Bowery’s servers until the end of the year, and we can help with any migration from our servers to another provider.
