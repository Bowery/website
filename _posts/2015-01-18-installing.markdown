## Install

### Installing on a Mac (Add screenshots)

When you open the Bowery package you will be greeted by a setup window. 
Click continue to save Bowery in your preferred directory. 
Congrats! Your installations was successful. 
Now open the Bowery app. This will take you to your finder to select a directory where you will be working on your code. 
Once you select the directory with your code, the Bowery Terminal will appear. Type `ls` and you will see all the folders in that directory, just like your Terminal. 
Before you start coding type `git status` to see if any files have changed. You will see that a `.bowery` was added to your directory. This is the file that stores a reference to your environment, making it possible to onboard new team members instantly and keep everyone's environments in sync. Do not delete this file. Your .bowery file captures all the information about your environment in an individual session. Once you are done coding and click to exit Bowery, it will prompt you to save your session. (insert save photo here). If you click save, all of your information will be saved to your .bowery file and able to be shared with others.
