Bowery is thrilled to be included in TechRepublic's list of "[10 Enterprise Startups to Watch in 2015.](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-enterprise-startups-to-watch-in-2015/)" We're in great company with companies like [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Bluebox](https://bluebox.com/) and [ElasticBox](https://elasticbox.com/).

At Bowery, we believe that collaboration is key to productivity. In 2015, we'll be focused on making Bowery the app that helps our users remove the distraction of maintaining your developer environment to focus on tackling new and imminent problems. There's been tremendous support for Bowery over the past few months and we're so excited to share what's next in 2015!
