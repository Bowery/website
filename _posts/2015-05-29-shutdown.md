**We’ll continue to operate as a company**, but the Development Environment as a Service product will cease to exist. Over the last two years we failed to make a product that was generally useful to our customers.

We’ve learned a lot about development environments and containerization, but not enough to hit the nail on the head.

We will apply what we learned by building custom development environments for clients. We plan to eventually launch a more general product from what we learn helping companies building their development environments.

Thank you to our customers for your support and business.
